# Machine-Learning-Models-from-Scratch
I will keep adding new files/ improvements whenever I have some time.


**Linear_regression_from_scratch.py**
- Implemented three Linear Regression models with a vectorized implementation of Gradient Descent from scratch
- Compared training time of For Loop vs. Vectorized implemenation
- Vectorized implementation is not only elegant but also reduces training time

**Logistic_regression_from_scratch.py**
- Implemented a Logistic Regression model with a vectorized implementation of Gradient Descent from scratch
