# Machine-Learning-Models-from-Scratch
I will keep adding new files/ improvements whenever I have some time.


**Linear_regression_from_scratch.py**
- Implemented three Linear Regression models with a vectorized implementation of Gradient Descent from scratch
- Compared training time of For Loop vs. Vectorized implemenation
- Vectorized implementation is not only elegant but also reduces training time

**Logistic_regression_from_scratch.py**
- Implemented a Logistic Regression model with a vectorized implementation of Gradient Descent from scratch

**Decision_Tree.py**
- Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch

**kmeans.py**
- Implemented the K-means clustering algorithm from scratch

**linear_algebra_ex01.py**
- Implemented functions to compute the determinant of a matrix as well as the approximate eigenvector and dominant eigenvalue of a square matrix from scratch to reinforce my understanding
